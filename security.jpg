To block an IP address using AWS CloudFront, you can use AWS WAF to create a rule that matches the IP address and blocks all traffic from that address. You can then associate the rule with a CloudFront distribution to ensure that it is applied to all requests that are routed to your distribution.

Here are the steps in brief:

☑️Go to the AWS WAF console.
☑️Create a rule of type "IP match".
☑️Enter the IP address you want to block in the "IP address" field.
☑️Select "Block" as the action.
☑️Associate the rule with the CloudFront distribution you want to protect.

The IP address you specified will now be blocked from accessing your content through CloudFront.

🎯AWS WAF rules are used to filter HTTP traffic to your web applications and block malicious requests. They can be used to protect against a wide range of attacks, such as SQL injection, XSS, and DoS attacks. It's a powerful tool that can help you protect your web applications.

To significantly improve the security of your application you need to carefully configure and maintain your rules.

🎯You can also Centralize AWS network inspection using Transit Gateway (TGW) which can be achieved by setting up a hub-and-spoke network architecture. But navigating this setup can be challenging.
